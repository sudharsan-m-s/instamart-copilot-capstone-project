-- Q1: WHERE then HAVING
-- Keep only completed orders with order_amount > 500 (WHERE), group by customer,
-- and keep customers whose total of those orders exceeds 8000 (HAVING).
SELECT
    customer_id,
    ROUND(SUM(order_amount), 2) AS total_spend
FROM orders
WHERE status = 'completed' AND order_amount > 500

-- Q2: Three-table JOIN
-- Revenue by city and product category (join orders, customers, products).
SELECT

JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE o.status = 'completed'
GROUP BY c.city, p.category

-- Q3: Scalar Subquery
-- Products priced above the average catalogue price.
SELECT
    product_id,
    product_name,
    category,
    price_inr
FROM products
WHERE price_inr > (SELECT AVG(price_inr) FROM products);

-- Customers who have no completed order.

-- Q5: Common Table Expression (CTE)
-- One CTE computes each customer's total completed spend and a second computes
-- the average of those totals, and the main query returns customers whose total is above average.
